problem_name: MoviePurchase

problem_description: |
  <p>The <code>MoviePurchase</code> class represents movie purchases on YouTube,
    tracking the title and cost of each movie bought,
    as well as the number of times the movie is watched.
  </p>
  <p>Each <code>MoviePurchase</code> instance should have three instance variables:
  <code>title</code>, <code>cost</code>, and <code>times_watched</code>.
  The <code>watch</code> method is responsible for increasing
  the <code>times_watched</code> of an instance.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  >>> ponyo = MoviePurchase("Ponyo", 19.99)
  >>> ponyo.title
  'Ponyo'
  >>> ponyo.cost
  19.99
  >>> ponyo.times_watched
  0
  >>> ponyo.watch()
  >>> ponyo.watch()
  >>> ponyo.times_watched
  2
  </code></pre>
