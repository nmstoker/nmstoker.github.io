problem_description: |
  <code>count_multiples</code>
    counts the number of multiples of divisor between the start and end numbers.
    It should include the start or end if they are a multiple.

  <pre><code>
  >>> count_multiples(2, 2, 1)       # 2 is a multiple of 1
  1
  >>> count_multiples(2, 2, 2)       # 2 is a multiple of 2
  1
  >>> count_multiples(2, 2, 3)       # 2 is not a multiple of 3
  0
  >>> count_multiples(1, 12, 3)      # 3, 6, 9, 12
  4
  >>> count_multiples(237, 500, 10)
  27
