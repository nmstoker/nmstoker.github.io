# problem_description is displayed on the problem page and provides the doctest details used to test the student's
# proposed solution
problem_description: |
  Return a string stating the area of a circle with the given radius
  
  State area to a given number of decimals with a default value of 2

  >>> area_circle(5)
  'Circle area is 78.54'
  >>> area_circle(5,4)
  'Circle area is 78.5398'
  >>> area_circle(7,0)
  'Circle area is 154'
  >>> area_circle(0)
  'Circle area is 0.00'
  >>> area_circle(-4)
  'Circle area is 50.27'
